# email-fetch

This project currently fetches the newest 10 emails from a Gmail mailbox using IMAP.

The long term goal is to extract and summarize internship application status updates from email. For example, the tool will later filter for messages about application confirmation, online assessments, interviews, rejections, and offers, then generate a simple digest.
